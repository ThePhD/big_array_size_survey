It's also not like the old versions of c have stopped working or that programs compiled before the new standard will stop working!

Honorable mention to count of because it would allow me to type the count of Monte Cristo in source code which would be funny.

If I had to write _Lenof every time I wanted to get the size of an array-like thing outside of macros without a pretty keyword macro, I think I'd lose it (Even though I'd probably just make one anyways. But I'd still be miffed about it). I'd feel fine with the underscore keyword with pretty macro just as a compromise for code bases that are already using it.

Fiascos like taking 30 years to add true and false can't continue to happen. If someone has a symbol named 'false' or 'lengthof' and has specified --gimme-C26 then they can take on the minute-long global search and replace in cscope, CLion, or (very carefully) sed.  Identifiers clash all the time in new development environments. They SHOULDN'T, but because there's not a contact between the set of symbols and behavoiurs requested and those available - this is just the kind of thing that developers of ACTIVELY MAINTAINED code expect.  The failure case is obvious and trivial to fix. Pick a good identifier (lengthof is like sizeof), don't hide it behind the presence of an include &lt;stdthing.h&gt; to activate it, and rip the bandaid off. Old code can stay on old compilers. When the old compilers don't run on computers that can be bought, borrowed, emulated, or virtualized, and a change MUST be made, then someone needs to exit denial and actually pay/bribe a programmer to actively maintain the stupid code.

I would accept a new keyword, but strongly prefer for all keywords (new & existing) to have the underscore+capital form, and then aliased or typedef’d in headers, since it’s backward-compatible and allows replacing standard definitions with custom ones."

I use ARRAY_COUNT (and CSTR_COUNT defined as (ARRAY_COUNT(array)-1) for string literals) in all of my projects specifically because ""count"" cannot be confused with ""length"", and I have found that this naming has made it much easier for junior developers to understand what is happening under the hood. I also think having some harmonization with MSVC & C# is also a net benefit for the ecosystem as a whole. Overall I strongly prefer either _Countof or countof as the spelling out of the choices mentioned."

The other options (including lenof) are more distant from sizeof and thus intuitively feel more likely to be something in a third-party header. I don't think the trailing-NUL problem with lengthof vs. strlen is a real problem (it's maybe more of a problem with lenof, but slightly). If you're taking new options, ""arraylenof"" or ""arraysizeof"" or ""arraysize"" (lowercase, no underscore, seems manageable) would avoid that ambiguity. Also, i hope that it only works on arrays, and that applying it to something that's decayed to a pointer or to any other scalar is a compile error."

With Cs interoperability with C++ ""sizeof"" would interact nicely with C++s way of receiving the number of elements in a storage type, but that clearly will not work out. At least in my surroundings - proffesional or hobby - arrays and lists with a lot of elements are refered to as ""long"", and not ""high cardinality"" or ""big"". The abbreviated sibling lenof/_Lenof is Cs usual dribble of letters which only insiders can decipher their meaning and if you stumble upon them without knowing a cat might as well have walked over the keyboard.  countof/_Countof is similar to lengthof/_Lengthof and closer to the actual meaning of ""what is the cardinality of this thing"". Same for nelementsof/_Nelementsof. I agree with it on an academic level that it should be one of those.  As for nelemsof/_Nelemsof. I think we can spare the additional three letters. Abbreviations do help, but we do not have to go full german and abbreviate everything."

There MISRA is prevailant and you may also find formal verification tooling and methodologies, if your mission is important and expensive enough. What all that mean, is that ambiguities and features that undermine type safety are not welcome. An operator that returns the number of elements in an array is much needed, so thank you for this work. As for the name, when I was learning C some years ago, I noticed that many of my friends and colleagues in my class were really confused with the ""_Ugly keyword-normal macro in the header"" which usually led to mistakes and frustration. I'd be lying if I said that I wasn't confused too. So, my preference is to not have any header, either provide a normal keyword (best case scenario), or provide a an _Ugly keyword, but to be honest, I won't really mind if the header ends up being provided. As for the names, I like extent, since it reminds me of numerical software, which is the kind of software I write in my free time. Also, since nelementsof can be provided as a keyword as is, it's also a pretty strong candidate. Even though, length is a pretty common term, and probably the most aesthetically pleasing one, you never know what's going inside the mind of someone who is just learning C, and ambiguities with strlen may actually happen. Though, at the same time, VLA is an existing term and is even used in MISRA, so those concerns may be hyperbolic. In the end, I'll use it anyway."

Doing so found some existing bugs and will eliminate countless more in the future. Maybe lengthof() should similarly not work on a string literal. The compiler can differentiate literals from other char arrays. We have 2 span ctor methods instead for string literals, span_from_cstring and span_from_cstring_with_nul. And the error when trying to construct span directly from a string literal points the user to these two blessed ways"
